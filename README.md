**StudyTimer** is a manifest v2 cross-platform browser extension created to help manage time and increase productivity using the **Pomodoro Technique**.

## ✨ Features

- **Automatic change**: Timer is changed automatically at the end of each interval or break
- **Customizable**: Set your preferred interval and break time
- **Save sessions**: Sessions are saved, resume them anytime
- **Autostart**: Start the timer as soon as you open the browser
- **Dark mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes

## 🍅 Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that breaks work into 25-minute focused intervals (Pomodoros), separated by 5-minute breaks. After four Pomodoros, you take a longer 15-30 minute break. It's designed to improve focus and productivity by balancing intense work and rest.
